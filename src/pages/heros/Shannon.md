Bardeen was a part of the team that built the first point-contact transistor. For that he shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics with his partners William Shockley and Walter Brattain. If that is not enough, he is also one of the inventors of BCS theory, one of the first successful theories that model superconductivity, for which he won his second Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972.
