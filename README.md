# Personal Website

This website can be found at <a href="https://computationtime.com" target="_blank">www.computationtime.com</a>. It was a pleasure to build it using astro, solidjs, and tailwind. I really liked this stack. It is automatically deployed to cloudflare pages with each push.

## 🧰 Tools

- Cloudflare
- Javascript
